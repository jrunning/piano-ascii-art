===============
Shows ASCII album art in pianobar. Looks terrible but for some reason I
love it.

Prerequisites
-------------
Requires img2txt, part of [libcaca][1].

You should use this script with a 256-color terminal.

Configuration
-------------
You can tweak the parameters given to img2txt by editing `img2txt-opts.sh`.
You might be able to make the output look nicer that way. Maybe.
